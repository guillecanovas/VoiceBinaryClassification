# Voice Classifier: Elon Musk vs. Tim Cook
This repository contains a neural network-based classification model capable of determining whether the voice in an .mp3 audio file belongs to Elon Musk or Tim Cook, two iconic business leaders and public figures.

## Key Features:

- **Voice Classification:** The solution utilizes a deep learning model to perform accurate classification between Elon Musk and Tim Cook's voices in audio files.

- **Training Data:** The model has been initially trained on a limited set of audio samples from both speakers, but it can be expanded to improve its accuracy.

- **Simple User Interface (To Do):** My plan is to provide an intuitive user interface to upload .mp3 files and obtain instant classification results.
